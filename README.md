# DSNN
Weight distribution analysis of two deep spiking neural networks built using the SpykeTorch tool.

• MozafariDeep.py: Reimplementation of the paper "Bio-Inspired Digit Recognition Using Reward-Modulated Spike-Timing- Dependent Plasticity in Deep Convolutional Networks" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320319301906).

• KheradpishehDeep.py: Reimplementation of the paper "STDP-based spiking deep convolutional neural networks for object recognition" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608017302903).

All code for these networks and the SpykeTorch tool are from the SpykeTorch GitHub repo: https://github.com/miladmozafari/SpykeTorch
